00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000


2
00:00:10.011 --> 00:00:12.084
Rafael is different from João Vicente

3
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.294
that is different from me and i'm not like you either

4
00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.605
Each person has different tastes, abilities and limitations.

5
00:00:27.188 --> 00:00:34.027
but we all have the right to communication, mobility, access to information and leisure

6
00:00:34.171 --> 00:00:36.679
we all seek autonomy

7
00:00:39.957 --> 00:00:42.503
the creation of solutions and the development of equipment

8
00:00:43.655 --> 00:00:47.237
are helping people with disabilities or functional problems

9
00:00:47.323 --> 00:00:51.611
to carry out activities and be included in society

10
00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:56.388
overcoming difficulties through assistive technology

11
00:00:56.567 --> 00:00:59.951
is today's topic by TVE Repórter

12
00:01:20.342 --> 00:01:22.597
with a watchful eye and the left hand

13
00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:24.519
about the adapted mouse

14
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.186
Rafael gives voice to your thoughts

15
00:01:27.454 --> 00:01:31.528
tell our team, what is your great passion


16
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.004
Computer: Popular fans in text

17
00:01:35.074 --> 00:01:36.537
Reporter: Do you watch every game?

18
00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:38.733
Reporter: From inter?


19
00:01:45.773 --> 00:01:48.281
Selecting letters on the virtual keyboard

20
00:01:48.368 --> 00:01:50.502
He forms the sentence he wants

21
00:01:50.811 --> 00:01:54.515
But it also manages to access the menu on the computer

22
00:01:54.636 --> 00:01:58.267
Categories in the form of symbols that are engraved

23
00:01:58.344 --> 00:02:00.432
facilitating communication

24
00:02:00.769 --> 00:02:05.637
The international for example has the placeholder on the home page

25
00:02:06.033 --> 00:02:10.111
and the team lineup is two clicks away

26
00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:11.727
Reporter: There's a lot of Inter stuff there...

27
00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:15.566
Computer: Alan Costa, defender

28
00:02:16.657 --> 00:02:18.258
Computer: Maldives, half

00:02:18.657 --> 00:02:25.518
Rafael is 18 years old, and has died since he was 6 at the Menino Jesus de Praga house in Porto Alegre

30
00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:27.712
with cerebral palsy

31
00:02:27.875 --> 00:02:30.966
his difficulties are mainly motor

32
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.720
good-humored.since he was a little boy, he found it easy to make friends

33
00:02:35.964 --> 00:02:38.571
the obstacle was the locomotion


34
00:02:38.651 --> 00:02:41.666
the solution comes on top of an engine
